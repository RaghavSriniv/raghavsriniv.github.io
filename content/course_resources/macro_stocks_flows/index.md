This course aims to prepare the groundwork for pursuing advanced topics in Macroeconomics. The novelty of the course is the use of the stock-flow accounting framework (SFC) to introduce and analyse contending perspectives in modern monetary macroeconomics. It equips the students with the alternative analytical frameworks that underpin and inform macroeconomic policy making in the context of modern financialized
economies.
