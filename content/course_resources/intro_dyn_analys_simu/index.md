### Welcome!


##### _We live in time, yet in economics classrooms, time stands still!_ ðŸ˜¸
<br>

Undergraduate economics teaching mainly uses the comparative static method.

>>The comparative static method is like taking snapshots of the system at different times and comparing them. But it does not tell us anything about the the transition between them - whether **journey** is bumpy or smooth! 

<br> 

**Dynamics** is the study about the quality of the journey and what makes the journey bumpy or smooth. 


>> **Simulation** is a tool to visualize the dynamics of the system, i.e., the journey. It's not just a computational tool, but it is an active learning tool to understand basic economic intuition.

<br>


### How to use the platform?

The aim of [**Econdyn-Lab**](https://raghavsrinivas.shinyapps.io/Model_1/) is to provide a simulation tool to help experimental learning in Economics.
<br>
<br> 
* First, play around the with the parameter values and initial conditions in various models and see how the output plots change -  thanks to our dynamic and talented intern **Aditya Mahadevan** for working on the simulation toolbars using the Shiny package in R (open source). ðŸ«¡
<br> 

* Second, go to the main reference [textbook](https://www.routledge.com/An-Introduction-to-Economic-Dynamics-Modelling-Analysis-and-Simulation/Raghavendra-Piiroinen/p/book/9780367341893?srsltid=AfmBOope-Gqo9JJP0K0daIguN1U2Ox5amZjuKVKVRzDjAiF5-Zh0tF22) and study the models to see how the dynamics in those plots are generated.
<br>

* Third, experimenting with the paramter values will help you understand what values make "economic" sense and what values don't!

<br>

##### _Simulate, Experiment, and Repeat_ ðŸ˜¹
