The course primarily deals with the determinations and relations of four variables, namely: 
1. Gross Domestic/National Product
2. Employment/unemployment
3. Price Level/Inflation-Deflation, and
4. Balance of Payments and the exchange rate. 

The course is primarily designed to give exposure to the students of the developments in macroeconomic theory during the 20<sup>th</sup> century, particularly on the developments following Keynes’ landmark publication of his _General Theory_ book in 1936.  The course will also introduce students to the macroeconomics of developing economies, referred to as in the literature as the ‘structuralist macroeconomics’.
